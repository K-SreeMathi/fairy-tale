    <p>
      In the breakfast town of Butterville, a very smart duck named Detective Quackers lived in a teapot-shaped house. He wore a tiny hat, carried a notepad, and always kept slices of toast in his detective bag.
    </p>

    <p>
      You see, Quackers wasn’t just smart—he was brilliant. And his secret crime-solving tool? Toast. Yes, toast! But not ordinary toast. His toast could bounce, stick, sparkle, and even sing clues when needed.
    </p>

    <p>
      One morning, the mayor rushed to Quackers’ door. “Someone stole the jelly fountain!” he cried.
    </p>

    <p>
      Quackers waddled to the crime scene, took a slice of cinnamon toast, and tossed it into the grass. *Boing!* It bounced toward a trail of glitter. “Aha,” said Quackers, “the thief left sparkle crumbs.”
    </p>

    <p>
      Next, he pulled out a raisin toast, which hummed quietly. “Follow the hum,” whispered the duck. The toast floated gently in the air, leading them behind the Pancake Park.
    </p>

    <p>
      There, behind a stack of sleepy syrup barrels, was a raccoon wearing jelly-stained gloves. “I was just testing the fountain!” he said with wide eyes.
    </p>

    <p>
      “Testing it in your backpack?” Quackers asked. The raccoon blushed and handed over a purple jelly bottle.
    </p>

    <p>
      “Case closed,” said the duck. Everyone clapped and gave Quackers a toast trophy.
    </p>

    <p>
      But the next day, another mystery arrived. The town’s butter butterflies were missing! Quackers took out his peanut butter toast this time. It zoomed around like a flying biscuit and stopped near the candy corn castle.
    </p>

    <p>
      Inside, the butterflies were sleeping on jellybean pillows. “They just needed a nap,” said the duck.
    </p>

    <p>
      Quackers returned them safely and made sure they had toast snacks too. From that day on, Butterville trusted him with every problem—no matter how sticky, syrupy, or sweet.
    </p>

    <p class="mt-4">
      And so, Detective Quackers became the most toast-worthy hero in breakfast land. Wherever there was trouble, you could bet your butter he’d solve it—with toast!
