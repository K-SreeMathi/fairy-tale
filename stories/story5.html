    <p>
      In the land of Mistywhirl, there lived a wizard named Waldo. He was very wise and very kind. But Waldo had one little problem—his pants kept disappearing.
    </p>

    <p>
      “Not again!” he would shout every morning as he looked in the mirror. His shirt, shoes, and hat were there. But his pants? Completely invisible.
    </p>

    <p>
      It all started when he tried to cast a spell to clean his laundry faster. “Sparkle-wash and vanish dirt!” he chanted. But he sneezed during the last word, and instead of washing the pants, he made them vanish forever.
    </p>

    <p>
      Now everywhere he went, people whispered, “There goes Waldo... the wizard with invisible pants!” It was very embarrassing.
    </p>

    <p>
      One day, while walking through the village market, a child asked, “Mr. Wizard, where are your pants?” Waldo turned red like a tomato. “They’re here,” he said. “Just... invisible.”
    </p>

    <p>
      The villagers didn’t laugh. Instead, they began to love his invisible pants. Some said it was a fashion trend. Others said he must be super magical.
    </p>

    <p>
      Waldo tried to bring his pants back with every spell he knew. “Un-hide! Re-appear! Materialize!” But nothing worked. Even a magical tailor couldn’t help. “Sorry,” the tailor said. “Invisible cloth is very tricky.”
    </p>

    <p>
      One day, Waldo helped a squirrel find her lost acorns using a tracking charm. In return, she gave him a golden acorn. “Make a wish,” she squeaked.
    </p>

    <p>
      Waldo closed his eyes and wished for something big. Not just pants—but pants that sparkled, stretched, and never disappeared.
    </p>

    <p>
      *POOF!* A pair of magical pants appeared on him! They shimmered with stars and had pockets that sang. He jumped with joy. “I’m fully dressed again!”
    </p>

    <p>
      From that day on, Waldo wore his magical pants with pride. He started a pants-help club for other wizards with wardrobe troubles. They called it “The Trouser Tower.”
    </p>

    <p class="mt-4">
      And so, Waldo the wizard learned that even small problems—like missing pants—can lead to big laughs and new friendships.
