    <p>
      Goldilocks had already visited the three bears, tried their porridge, and learned her lesson about sneaking into houses. But now she was older, wiser, and always ready for an adventure — especially if it included sparkles.
    </p>

    <p>
      One sunny morning, she wandered into a hidden garden behind the hills. There, in the middle of a circle of singing daisies, stood a magical fountain. But instead of coins or water, it was filled with glittering jellyfish and talking goldfish!
    </p>

    <p>
      A small fish in a top hat popped up and said, “Welcome to the Fishy Wish Fountain! Toss in something silly, and your wish might come true.”
    </p>

    <p>
      Goldilocks blinked. “Something silly?”
    </p>

    <p>
      “Yes,” the fish said. “No money. Only bananas, buttons, or left socks will do.”
    </p>

    <p>
      Luckily, Goldilocks always kept a silly sock in her backpack — just in case. She dropped it in. The fountain bubbled, and out popped a flying sandwich. “Oops!” said the fish. “Wrong wish. Try again.”
    </p>

    <p>
      Goldilocks giggled and tossed in a pink jellybean. This time, a soft rainbow cloud lifted her gently off the ground. “Whoa! I wished for a nap spot, and got this!”
    </p>

    <p>
      Over the next hour, she watched a hedgehog get a unicorn mustache, a cat learn to dance ballet, and a snail win a trumpet concert.
    </p>

    <p>
      “This place is magical,” she said. “But why doesn’t everyone come here?”
    </p>

    <p>
      The fish whispered, “Because most people forget how to be silly.”
    </p>

    <p>
      Goldilocks promised to bring more kids who believed in fun. She visited every week with silly things — rubber ducks, glitter crayons, and once, a pancake shaped like a hat.
    </p>

    <p>
      The garden became famous for silly wishes and warm smiles. And Goldilocks became the official “Wish Whisker” of the fountain — guiding others to believe in magic, kindness, and giggles.
    </p>

    <p class="mt-4">
      And so, in a world full of serious things, Goldilocks reminded everyone that a little silly can make the biggest dreams come true.
