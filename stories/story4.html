    <p>
      In the quiet town of Pinebark, the animals lived happily. Rabbits bounced, squirrels sang, and birds flew in circles just for fun. But one thing was missing: a good mayor. The old mayor, Mr. Moose, always fell asleep during meetings!
    </p>

    <p>
      One morning, near the river, the animals found something strange — a log with eyes! The log blinked, stretched its tiny arms made of twigs, and said, “Good morning! I’m Larry the Log.”
    </p>

    <p>
      Everyone gasped. “A talking log?” asked a duck. “That’s impossible!”
    </p>

    <p>
      But Larry smiled and said, “I may be made of wood, but I’m full of ideas.”
    </p>

    <p>
      Larry helped build a library out of mushroom walls. He stopped a beaver flood using a hat and a spoon. He even taught chipmunks how to plant cookie seeds. (They didn’t grow cookies, but they grew happy!)
    </p>

    <p>
      One day, the animals shouted, “Larry for Mayor!” Larry laughed. “But I’m just a log!” Still, he agreed to try. He wore a flower crown and held speeches on top of a giant snail.
    </p>

    <p>
      “I promise no meetings will be boring!” he shouted. “I’ll make the town fun, fair, and full of snacks!”
    </p>

    <p>
      The birds clapped their wings, and the turtles danced slowly. Even grumpy Mr. Moose smiled a little.
    </p>

    <p>
      Larry won the election! On his first day as mayor, he declared “Pajama Tuesday” and made sure every tree got a hug.
    </p>

    <p>
      He built rainbow slides between treehouses and placed tiny mailboxes for ants. Every creature had a voice, even the shy worms.
    </p>

    <p>
      “You’re the best mayor ever!” said a squirrel.
    </p>

    <p>
      Larry the Log blushed (as much as wood could) and said, “When you listen with your heart, you don’t need legs to lead.”
    </p>

    <p class="mt-4">
      And so, Pinebark became the happiest forest in the world — all thanks to one kind, clever, talking log who truly cared.
