    <h2 class="text-center mb-4">🐉 The Cupcake-Breathing Dragon</h2>

    <p>
      Deep in the land of Crumbletop, where volcanoes whistled and gumdrop trees grew wild, there lived a dragon named Dave. But Dave wasn’t your ordinary roar-and-fire kind of dragon. No, Dave had a very special quirk: instead of breathing fire, he breathed cupcakes.
    </p>

    <p>
      It started when he was a hatchling. One sneeze and out popped a blueberry muffin with extra glitter. Another hiccup? A flying chocolate chip cupcake that sang lullabies. His parents, who were traditional lava-blasters, were baffled.
    </p>

    <p>
      “He’s sweet!” his mom declared. “Literally!” said his dad, licking frosting from a tree.
    </p>

    <p>
      Dave became famous across the land. Villagers would line up near his cave not with swords—but with forks. He could bake vanilla swirl, strawberry sparkle, even lemon-zap surprise with a single puff. His cave smelled like a dessert shop and was guarded not by treasure—but by frosting gnomes.
    </p>

    <p>
      But one day, a mysterious baker named Madame Crustina arrived. She wore a hat shaped like a pie and had a rolling pin that glowed. “I hear you’re the dragon with the dessert breath,” she said, squinting.
    </p>

    <p>
      Dave nodded politely and sneezed a caramel puff. It floated past her nose.
    </p>

    <p>
      Crustina gasped. “That… smells like victory!” She had a wicked plan: steal Dave’s recipe and make millions of magic cupcakes without him!
    </p>

    <p>
      That night, she crept into his cave with a frosting vacuum and a spellbook. But when she turned the pages, a cupcake trap popped open! It shot her straight into a jelly trampoline and bounced her into a marshmallow bush. Dave snored gently nearby, unaware of the chaos.
    </p>

    <p>
      The next morning, Dave woke to find Crustina stuck to a candy cane. “Trying to steal secret recipes?” he asked.
    </p>

    <p>
      She sighed, “I just wanted to be as magical as you.”
    </p>

    <p>
      Dave smiled kindly. “Magic tastes better when shared.” And with that, he taught her how to sneeze cinnamon properly. They opened a bakery together called **"Flame & Frosting"**, and it became the coziest, happiest shop in Crumbletop.
    </p>

      And so, the dragon who breathed cupcakes didn’t just sweeten the skies—he sweetened hearts too.
