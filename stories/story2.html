    <p>
      After marrying the prince, Cinderella quickly discovered that royal life was not all balls and ballroom dancing. Sure, she loved sparkly gowns and fancy tea, but she missed making things with her own two hands.
    </p>

    <p>
      So one morning, while sipping peppermint cocoa in the palace garden, Cinderella had a brilliant idea. “What if I opened a factory that makes magical glass slippers? Slippers for everyone! Not just princesses.”
    </p>

    <p>
      The very next day, she opened **“Slipperella Inc.”**, a cheerful little factory at the edge of the kingdom. Her team included seven whistling dwarfs from down south, three fashion-forward mice, and a very serious unicorn named Barry who was in charge of sparkles.
    </p>

    <p>
      The slippers were special. They could grow to fit any foot, never got smelly, and even played a sweet harp tune with every step. People from every corner of the land placed orders. There were slippers that glowed, slippers that bounced, and even slippers with teeny umbrellas for rainy days!
    </p>

    <p>
      But then, something odd happened.
    </p>

    <p>
      A batch of slippers started… vanishing. Not stolen, not misplaced—just poof! One second they were there, the next, gone. And sometimes, they came back… years before they were even made!
    </p>

    <p>
      “Time-traveling slippers?” Cinderella blinked at the talking clock on her desk. “Are you sure?”
    </p>

    <p>
      “Tick-tock totally,” said the clock. “You must’ve added fairy dust meant for time-travel tea, not slipper glue.”
    </p>

    <p>
      Soon, slipper customers were showing up at the castle saying things like, “Your slipper took me to next Thursday!” and “I danced with a baby dragon in the past!”
    </p>

    <p>
      Cinderella and Barry the Unicorn had to fix it. They gathered all the time-twirling slippers and stored them in a jellybean-proof vault (just in case the jellybeans were magical too). Then she created a new motto:  
      <em>“Only present-day sparkle, guaranteed!”</em>
    </p>

    <p>
      After that, the factory ran smoothly. Slippers were back to being twinkly, dancey, and perfectly placed in time. Cinderella even gave her stepsisters a free pair each. They cried, then slipped, then cried again from joy.
    </p>

    <p class="mt-4">
      And so, Cinderella’s Slipper Factory became the happiest (and safest) slipper shop in the kingdom—with not a single accidental time-hop ever again.
