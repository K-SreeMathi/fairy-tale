    <p>
      Once upon a lily pad in the land of Flipflop Forest, lived a frog named Freddy. Unlike every other frog in the swamp, Freddy absolutely hated water. Not just disliked it—he refused to touch it, hop in it, or even look at it for too long. He wore tiny boots and carried a towel everywhere he went. When it rained, he popped open a leaf umbrella and yelled, “Not on my toes, thank you!”
    </p>

    <p>
      Freddy built a treehouse way above the pond. It had a drawbridge made of twigs and a pulley basket to send snacks up. His friends would croak and splash happily in the water below, but Freddy stayed dry and cozy in his leaf hammock. “Water is too wiggly!” he declared. “Too splashy! Too splash-sploshy!”
    </p>

    <p>
      One evening, the sky turned purple and swirly. A strange cloud floated down and rumbled, “Prepare for the Upside-Down Rain!” Suddenly, water didn’t fall from the sky—it rose up from the pond like a waterfall in reverse!
    </p>

    <p>
      Frogs leapt in all directions as bubbles floated past their noses. Freddy’s treehouse began to float gently upward, lifted by the swirling mist. He panicked. “I never trained for sky-sailing!” he croaked.
    </p>

    <p>
      Just then, a friendly turtle wearing goggles floated by on a soap bubble. “You look like you could use a shell,” the turtle smiled. Freddy hopped onto the turtle’s back, clinging on as they soared through the Upside-Down Rain. The wind made silly sounds like “blubbity-boop!” and the bubbles sang in harmony.
    </p>

    <p>
      At the top of the raincloud was a floating castle made of flower petals and clouds. Inside, everything was perfectly dry. The Queen of Clouds offered Freddy a crown made of mist and asked, “Would you like to be the Ambassador of Dryland?”
    </p>

    <p>
      Freddy accepted with a bow. From that day on, he helped frogs who wanted to play both in the water and the sky. He even dipped his toe into a warm puddle once and declared, “Not bad. Still not great—but not bad.”
    </p>

    <p class="mt-4">
      And so, Freddy the Frog who hated water became Freddy the Frog who helped everyone float—even if he still carried a towel, just in case.
