    <p>
      Rapunzel’s hair had always been long—very long. But ever since she started using magical mango shampoo, her hair wouldn’t stop growing. It grew during the day. It grew during the night. It grew while she slept, danced, and even when she sneezed!
    </p>

    <p>
      One morning, Rapunzel woke up to find her hair had filled her entire tower. It wrapped around her bed, spun around her tea kettle, and even knocked over her painting of a cat in sunglasses.
    </p>

    <p>
      “Oh my hairbrush!” she gasped. “It’s taken over the room!”
    </p>

    <p>
      Soon, the hair spilled out of the window, down the tower, and across the forest. Birds built nests in it. Squirrels rode it like a rollercoaster. Even trolls started using it as a hammock!
    </p>

    <p>
      The more Rapunzel trimmed, the faster it grew. Finally, it all bunched up into one giant, round, squishy… hairball. But this wasn’t just any hairball—it rolled, it bounced, and it floated!
    </p>

    <p>
      “It’s so big… it’s turning into a planet!” yelled the forest wizard, looking through his mushroom telescope.
    </p>

    <p>
      Rapunzel climbed up the giant hairball with a basket of banana muffins and waved to her friends below. “I guess I live in space now!” she said cheerfully.
    </p>

    <p>
      She built a tiny castle on top of the hairball using marshmallows and sparkling jelly bricks. Her new home spun gently in the sky, circling above the kingdom like a soft, sweet-smelling moon.
    </p>

    <p>
      Space squirrels came to visit. She planted jellybean flowers and grew starlight strawberries. Best of all, she could swing around the planet on her own hair like a ride at the fair.
    </p>

    <p>
      Sometimes she sent down magical postcards that read, “Wish you were hair!” and “Keep brushing, earthlings!”
    </p>

    <p class="mt-4">
      And so, Rapunzel became the first princess to live on a floating hairball planet. She was happy, free, and never ever ran out of shampoo.
