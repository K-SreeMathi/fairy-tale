    <p>
      In the garden of Twinkleleaf, there lived a tiny snail named Zoom. Zoom wasn’t like other snails. While others enjoyed slow walks and quiet naps, Zoom dreamed of speed.
    </p>

    <p>
      “One day,” Zoom whispered to a ladybug, “I’ll go so fast, I’ll race a shooting star!”
    </p>

    <p>
      The bugs laughed kindly. “That’s a lovely dream,” said a butterfly. “But stars are in the sky, and you… well, you're down here.”
    </p>

    <p>
      But Zoom believed. Every day he trained. He slid on buttered leaves, zipped down dewy branches, and even did push-ups with his eyestalks.
    </p>

    <p>
      One night, a glowing comet named Starley zipped low through the sky. She heard Zoom’s wish on the wind. She swirled down and hovered above the garden.
    </p>

    <p>
      “You want to race me, little one?” Starley asked gently.
    </p>

    <p>
      Zoom blinked. “Yes. Just once. I know I’m slow, but I believe in trying big things.”
    </p>

    <p>
      Starley twinkled brightly. “Then let’s do it. We race from this mushroom to that mountain top.”
    </p>

    <p>
      The whole garden came to watch. Ants waved flags made of rose petals. Frogs made trumpet sounds. Even the clouds held still.
    </p>

    <p>
      “Ready, set, GLOW!” shouted a firefly.
    </p>

    <p>
      Starley zoomed up, lighting the sky with rainbow trails. Zoom pushed forward, inch by inch, shell glowing with effort. He wasn’t fast, but he never stopped.
    </p>

    <p>
      Hours passed. Starley finished first, of course. But when Zoom reached the top—every creature cheered. Starley herself floated down and placed a shiny star sticker on his shell.
    </p>

    <p>
      “You didn’t win the race,” she said, “but you won something greater—you inspired the whole garden.”
    </p>

    <p class="mt-4">
      From that night on, Zoom was known as the bravest snail in the stars. And whenever a shooting star flew across the sky, everyone whispered, “That’s Starley, visiting her favorite racing snail.”
